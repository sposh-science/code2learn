# About

Code2Learn is a repository of small Python scripts designed to help students learn
science and mathematics concepts while learning programming at the same time.

Most of the original code examples were written by Dr. Ajith Kumar for Phoenix
project. These examples were later integrated into
[pycode-browser](https://github.com/vimaljoseph/pycode-browser) project.

The purpose of this repository is to keep the examples code separate from the
browser source code. We also want to work on improved code readability and
compatibility with Python versions 2 and 3.
